#  update.sh — move an installed app to a newer version
#
#  Usage:
#      bash <state-dir>/scripts/update.sh [OPTIONS]
#
#  Options:
#      --version TAG   Update to a specific version (default: resolve latest)
#      --yes           Do not prompt (required for downgrades / non-interactive)
#      --help, -h      Show this help
#
#  Order of operations:
#      compare versions -> refuse same/downgrade -> pre-update hook
#      -> fetch + swap -> post-update hook -> refresh unit -> restart + health
#      -> rollback hint
#
#  DIST=binary swaps a release tarball's payload (executable + vec0.so +
#  lib/libonnxruntime.so.1) instead of a git checkout; see

    # mktemp_owned, not `out="$(mktemp)"`: the bare mktemp was never registered
    # with the EXIT trap, so every hook run left its transcript in TMPDIR — 91
    # files per run of the deploy suite, on the same filesystem production's
    # SQLite database lives on. The transcript is a temp file, not an artefact:
    # nothing names it after the hook returns, so owning it is correct.
    #
    # WHY `${PIPESTATUS[0]}` (task #1102). The construct here used to be
    # `{ "$hook" 2>&1 || rc=$?; } | tee "$out"`, and it could not report a failed
    # hook: the `|| rc=$?` runs in the LEFT STAGE of a pipeline, and a pipeline
    # stage is a SUBSHELL, so the assignment died there and the parent shell only
    # ever saw tee's status (always 0). A pre-update hook exiting 7 therefore
    # reached `if ! run_hook pre-update` as success, and the guard that a failed
    # database backup must not be followed by a code swap was unreachable — while
    # the comment above claimed the status "crossed the pipe" and update.sh:809
    # called the hook fatal. Reproduced on this host; the fix is to read the
    # stage's own status after the pipeline instead of trying to write it from
    # inside one.
    #
    # Why not the alternatives:
    #   * `${PIPESTATUS[0]}` — what this uses. The hook's real status, streaming
    #     and capture untouched, and `|| rc=` keeps the non-zero pipeline from
    #     tripping `set -e`. Index 0 specifically, so a tee failure (ENOSPC — this
    #     host has filled / before) is NOT misreported as a hook failure.
    #   * plain `|| rc=$?` on the pipeline — works only because `set -o pipefail`
    #     is on, and then it attributes tee's failure to the hook, so a full disk
    #     aborts the update as if the backup had failed.
    #   * `set -e` on the pipeline — rejected by the AC and by the code: it would
    #     abort the script from inside a function whose caller is written to
    #     decide what a hook failure means.
    #   * dropping the tee — not an option at all: the transcript is what

# ── restart policy: the source-mode half of the unit refresh ────────────────
# Deliver the template's restart policy to a SOURCE-mode host.
#
# refresh_unit() re-renders the whole unit in binary mode, which carries the
# Restart= line with it. Source mode returns early there, because a full
# re-render would clobber an operator's hand edits — and that made the policy
# UNDELIVERABLE to exactly the hosts that need it: production is DIST=source
# (ExecStart=bun run start), so after the 2026-09-30 outage (an agent's
# name-pattern pkill; the process handled SIGTERM and exited 0; Restart=
# on-failure then left it down for 12 minutes) an update would have kept
# Restart=on-failure forever.
#
# So source mode gets a SURGICAL refresh: the existing Restart= line is rewritten
# in place, and only when it differs. Every other byte of the unit — an operator's
# hand edits included — is preserved, which is the invariant the early return was
# protecting. Nothing is ever INSERTED: a unit with no Restart= line is left
# alone and warned about rather than having a directive appended into an unknown
# section.
#
# Never fatal, unlike refresh_unit: an undelivered restart policy leaves a
# running service (the pre-incident behaviour), whereas failing here would block
# updates outright on a host that is otherwise fine. Every path returns 0.
#
# The write is ATOMIC and the messages describe the unit ON DISK, never the one
# this function meant to write. Both were defects of the first version, found in
# review of d9ff4bb:
#   * `cp -f "$tmp" "$unit"` opens the destination O_TRUNC and then writes, so a
#     copy that died partway (ENOSPC/EIO/killed — the class of event that took
#     production down on 2026-09-30) left the live unit truncated at 24 bytes,
#     while the message said "unchanged ... it still says Restart=on-failure".
#     Both halves were false: the file no longer contained Restart= at all, and
#     the staged good copy was rm -rf'd on the way out. Now the new body is
#     staged beside the unit and swapped in with rename(2), so the unit is
#     either the old file or the new one — never a hybrid — and the previous
#     body is kept as <unit>.bak the way the binary path keeps one.
#     That staging lives in lib/common.sh's write_file_atomically(), which
#     install.sh and refresh_unit() below also use: the same O_TRUNC pattern
#     survived in those two entry points (task #1094) precisely because the
#     mechanism was inlined here instead of shared, so it is shared now.
#   * A unit's mode was forced to 644, which widened a hand-edited unit that may
#     carry Environment= secrets. cp -f over an existing file does not change
#     its mode, so the chmod bought nothing and only ever lost the operator's
#     choice. The mode is now read from the unit and re-applied to the STAGED
#     file by write_file_atomically(), which also stages that file 600 BEFORE
#     any byte lands in it and widens it only after the copy succeeded — the
#     staging file used to inherit the awk render's 644 (umask 022), so a failed
#     stage left the start of a 600 unit, Environment= secrets included, in a
#     world-readable file in the unit directory, and it was left there (task
#     #1094: both findings reproduced, both now covered by the shared function).

# render_systemd_unit() has exactly TWO call sites in the framework: install.sh's
# install_service() and this refresh_unit(). (The note here used to say ONE and
# named install.sh alone. The invariant it argues for — one renderer, so a fix
# cannot reach one entry point and miss the other — was always intact; the COUNT
# was wrong, and it was wrong in the direction that hides work: an audit reading
# "one call site" concludes the update path cannot change the body, and stops
# looking. This function is the second site, and it is the only one that runs on
# every update.)
#
# A unit written before a line existed — the LD_LIBRARY_PATH line, and now the
# Group=/StateDirectory=/EnvironmentFile=/bounded-stop lines — therefore kept its
# old body through every update, so a host that updates INTO binary mode would
# run a binary whose embedder cannot dlopen libonnxruntime.so.1 (ADR 0001 §2.2).
# Binary mode re-renders and reinstalls the unit here.
#
# Scope is deliberately narrow: source mode returns immediately, because a full
# re-render would clobber an operator's hand edits to the unit. (The other half of
# that justification — "the rendered body is unchanged for source mode" — stopped
# being true once the template gained its Restart= line, so source mode no longer
# returns without an effect: it delegates to ensure_restart_policy above, which
# rewrites that one line and nothing else. A full re-render is still refused.)
#
# In binary mode a refresh that did NOT happen is FATAL (returns 1, and main()
# aborts before the restart). Rationale: the payload has already been swapped at
# this point, so a unit left without Environment=LD_LIBRARY_PATH is a unit that
# starts the new binary with an embedder which dies on ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED — and
# /health still answers status "ok", so nothing downstream would notice. The one
# case that stays non-fatal is a host with NO unit on disk (a --no-service or
# container install): there is nothing there to go stale.
